Error received:   fatal: parameter inet_interfaces: no local interface found for ::1 postfix

When:  While starting postfix

Where: Test system

Fix: 


Edit the file /etc/postfix/main.cf
vim /etc/postfix/main.cf
search for the line inet_interfaces = all
And change it to:
inet_interfaces = 127.0.0.1, 10.10.11.12 10.10.11.12 is your local IP address
:wq! Save and exit

If the above, still does not fix, then go to /etc/hosts and comment the line for ::1
